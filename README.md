# Reject or Fail to Reject? 

### A hypothesis testing application that will ease you in determining your conclusion!

In this **Hypothesis Testing Application**:
- Ask the user to input data (minimum of 30, assuming Normality)
- Choose the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
- The alternative hypothesis could be 
- Choose the significance level (options: 0.10, 0.05, 0.01)
- This application will then run and decide whether we should reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis

This Java desktop application will mostly be targeted to all, especially those
who fancy the Statistics and Data Science field.
This project interest me since I myself is deeply fascinated with the Statistics and Data Science field.
I'm a Statistics major myself and by making this application, it can help me in doing Hypothesis Testing without 
going through the rough work on my own!
