# Pomodoro Technique Timer

## A timer to help you study more effectively

In this **Pomodoro Timer**:
- When the start button is pressed, the timer will start
- When the timer reaches zero, the timer will stop
- One completed work session will always be followed by a break afterwards
- The duration for both the work and break session can be adjusted accordingly
  (however it's recommended to set it the work session to 25 minutes and break session to 5 minutes)
- Reset button to reset the timer
- User will be able to see how long they have done their work session

This Java desktop application will mostly be targeted to student, for all ages. 
It could also be used to anyone who wants to focus on doing their tasks without any distractions.
The pomodoro technique is known to be highly effective to help people manage their time
more wisely and disciplined. This project interests me since I have always implemented
this Pomodoro technique, and I found it helpful for me in finishing all my to-do list for the day.
From my point of view, having to work in a short period of time makes it easier to start, especially when it 
comes to monotonous tasks. I personally like to track how long I study, hence by this project, I can then 
use my own timer and set it to my own preferences.
