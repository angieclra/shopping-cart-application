# Reject or Fail to Reject? 

### A hypothesis testing application that will ease your decision-making!

In this **Statistical Hypothesis Testing Application**:
- The instructions will be written down in the beginning of the application in order to guide the user
- Ask the user to input data (minimum of 30, assuming Normality)
- This data will then be used for the hypothesis testing
- Define the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
- The null hypothesis must be equal to a number 
- The alternative hypothesis could be less, greater, and not equal to or two-sided test
- Choose the significance level (options: 0.10, 0.05, 0.01)
- If significance level is not given, 0.05 is then assumed
- Compute the test statistic
- Help the user reach a conclusion to decide on the null hypothesis

This Java desktop application will mostly be targeted to all, especially those
who fancy the Statistics and Data Science field. We know how making an educated guess or 
a hypothesis is something crucial in the world of science and business in making a decision.
This project interest me since I myself is deeply fascinated with the Statistics and Data Science field.
I'm a Statistics major myself and by making this application, it can help me in doing Hypothesis Testing without 
going through the rough work on my own!
